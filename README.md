Corporate DevOps Pipeline Project

This repository contains the code and configuration files for a Corporate DevOps Pipeline project. The project demonstrates the end-to-end setup of a CI/CD pipeline using various DevOps tools and practices.


Project Overview
The Corporate DevOps Pipeline project is designed to automate the software development lifecycle, ensuring efficient code integration, continuous testing, and deployment. The project covers the full spectrum of DevOps practices, from setting up the infrastructure to monitoring the deployed applications.

Architecture Flow
The architecture of this project follows a typical DevOps pipeline setup, involving several key components like Kubernetes clusters, virtual machines, Jenkins for CI/CD, SonarQube for code quality analysis, Nexus for artifact management, and more.

Phases of the Project:

Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

Kubernetes Cluster Setup: The first phase involves setting up a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster that serves as the foundation for deploying and managing containerized applications.

Security Scan of K8s Cluster: After setting up the cluster, a security scan is performed to ensure the cluster's security.

Create VMs for Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus: Virtual Machines (VMs) are created to host Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus, which are critical components of the CI/CD pipeline.

Phase 2: Git Repository and CI/CD Pipeline

Git Repository Setup: A Git repository is initialized to manage the source code.

Jenkins Configuration: Jenkins is configured to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

CI/CD Full Stack Pipeline: A complete CI/CD pipeline is set up, enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery of applications.

Phase 3: Monitoring

Monitoring Tools Setup: In the final phase, monitoring tools are configured to keep track of the application's performance and health.

Tools and Technologies Used

Kubernetes (K8s): For container orchestration.

Jenkins: For automating the CI/CD pipeline.

SonarQube: For code quality analysis.

Nexus: For artifact management.

Prometheus/Grafana: For monitoring and alerting.

Docker: For containerization.

Git: For version control.

Security Considerations
Perform regular security scans on the Kubernetes cluster.
Ensure that Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus are running with secure configurations.
Monitor the CI/CD pipeline for any potential security vulnerabilities.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of a corporate-level DevOps pipeline, covering everything from infrastructure setup to monitoring. The use of various tools and technologies ensures a robust, scalable, and secure pipeline for continuous integration and delivery.
